## 🤔 Notes & Decisions

Used Tailwind CSS for styling speed and consistency.

Avoided all UI libraries (e.g., MUI, AntD) as per instructions.

Used IntersectionObserver for scroll-triggered animations instead of animation libraries.

Data is loaded via mock fetchData() functions and managed with useState.

Designed components mobile-first and layered up for larger breakpoints.
